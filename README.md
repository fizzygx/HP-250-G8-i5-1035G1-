What doesnt work?

-Brightness keys need to be remapped in MacOS->Setting Preferences->Keyboard->Display-> Then assign e.g FN+F2 for decreasing brightness & Fn+F3 for increasing brightness

-Trackpad Tap and Hold isnt working theres need to use the left key and trackpad to move items

-Native Card Realtek only works bluetooth so i changed mine to an Intel Wireless card i had lying around for both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so id advise get a new one according to the dortania guide.
